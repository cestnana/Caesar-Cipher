# TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt()' that takes 'original_text' and 'shift_amount' as 2 inputs.

# TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt()' function, shift each letter of the 'original_text' forwards in the alphabet
#  by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.

# TODO-4: What happens if you try to shift z forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?

# TODO-3: Call the 'encrypt()' function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a
#  message.
