Step.1: 

# TODO-1: Create a function called 'encrypt()' that takes 'original_text' and 'shift_amount' as 2 inputs.

# TODO-2: Inside the 'encrypt()' function, shift each letter of the 'original_text' forwards in the alphabet
#  by the shift amount and print the encrypted text.

# TODO-4: What happens if you try to shift z forwards by 9? Can you fix the code?

# TODO-3: Call the 'encrypt()' function and pass in the user inputs. You should be able to test the code and encrypt a
#  message.

Step.2: 

# TODO-1: Create a function called 'decrypt()' that takes 'original_text' and 'shift_amount' as inputs.
# TODO-2: Inside the 'decrypt()' function, shift each letter of the 'original_text' *backwards* in the alphabet
#  by the shift amount and print the decrypted text.
# TODO-3: Combine the 'encrypt()' and 'decrypt()' functions into one function called 'caesar()'.
#  Use the value of the user chosen 'direction' variable to determine which functionality to use.

Step.3: 

# TODO-1: Import and print the logo from art.py when the program starts.
# TODO-2: What happens if the user enters a number/symbol/space?
# TODO-3: Can you figure out a way to restart the cipher program?
